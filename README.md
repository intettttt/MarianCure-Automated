# MarianCure-Automated

MarianCure-Automated is a test automation project built using Cypress for the MarianCure web application. This project aims to automate testing processes to ensure the reliability and functionality of MarianCure across different scenarios.

Prerequisites
Before running the automated tests, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- VS Code
- Cypress

Running Cypress is straightforward using VS Code. Follow these steps:

Open VS Code and go to the terminal. Then, open a new terminal.
Install Cypress by running the command: npm install cypress --save-dev.
Cypress typically creates a cypress directory in your project where it stores its configuration, test files, plugins, and related files. If it doesn't, initialize it by running: npx cypress open.
After initialization, Cypress prompts you to choose between E2E or Component Testing. Then, it prompts you to select a browser for testing.
Once you've made your selections, you can start testing or run the code.

You can add new file in the vs code and paste the codes from github and start the testing.
